Smarter Hauling
===============

Smarter Hauling improves the way your crew manages inventory in Ostranauts. Instead of hauling one item at a time and then returning to storage, crew members will now fill their pockets with multiple items before making the trip. You can also tell storage containers which types of items they should hold, so the right things end up in the right places.


What it does
------------

**Container preferences**: Right-click any storage container to open its settings. You can pick categories of items or specific items you want that container to accept. When crew haul items, they will automatically deliver them to the container you configured. If no preferences are set, hauling works the same as it always has.


**How it works:**
- Select any container on your ship
- Click the new **"Storage Settings"** button that appears in the tooltip
- A settings panel will appear showing all available item categories
- Click the checkbox icons to configure what the container accepts:
  - **:green_circle: Green Checkmark** = This category/item is **fully enabled** (all items will be stored here)
  - **:yellow_circle: Yellow Square** = This category is **partially enabled** (some subcategories/items are enabled, but not all)
  - **:red_circle: Red Square** = This category/item is **disabled** (won't be stored here)

**Example uses:**
- Mark a freezer to only accept food items
- Dedicate a specific locker for tools and equipment
- Set up a medical bay storage to only accept medical supplies
- Create organized tool chests that only accept specific item types

What you should know
--------------------

- Preferences only affect hauling. You can still manually place any item in any container.
- If a container has no preferences set, hauling uses the default zone rules from the game.
- Multiple containers can accept the same category. The mod picks the one with the most empty space.
- Items that do not fit any container's preferences will be hauled to the default storage zone.
- Damaged or loose containers are ignored by the preference system.
