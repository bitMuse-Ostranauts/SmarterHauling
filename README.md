Smarter Hauling
===============

Smarter Hauling improves the way your crew manages inventory in Ostranauts. Instead of hauling one item at a time and then returning to storage, crew members will now fill their pockets with multiple items before making the trip. You can also tell storage containers which types of items they should hold, so the right things end up in the right places.


What it does
------------

**Container preferences**: Right-click any storage container to open its settings. You can pick categories of items or specific items you want that container to accept. When crew haul items, they will automatically deliver them to the container you configured. If no preferences are set, hauling works the same as it always has.


How to use it
-------------

1. Install LaunchControl and Smarter Hauling into your BepInEx plugins folder.
2. Start the game and load your save.
3. Right-click a storage container (locker, crate, bin, anything with storage).
4. Look for the "Storage Settings" panel in the tooltip. Click the Settings button.
5. A window opens showing item categories. Click the checkbox next to a category to allow or block it.
6. Close the window. The container now remembers your choices and crew will deliver matching items there automatically.

Categories are grouped by type: Food, Tools, Medical, and so on. If you expand a category, you can pick individual items instead. The preferences save with your game, so you only need to set it up once per container.


What you should know
--------------------

- Preferences only affect hauling. You can still manually place any item in any container.
- If a container has no preferences set, hauling uses the default zone rules from the game.
- Multiple containers can accept the same category. The mod picks the one with the most empty space.
- Items that do not fit any container's preferences will be hauled to the default storage zone.
- Damaged or loose containers are ignored by the preference system.
